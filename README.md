# High Dimensional and Deep Learning

## Presentation :

 

The main theme of the course is learning methods, especially deep neural networks, for  processing  high dimensional  data, such as signals or images. We will cover the following topics:

 

* Neural networks and introduction to deep learning: definition of neural networks, activation functions, multilayer perceptron, backpropagation algorithms, optimization algorithms, regularization  
**Application** : [Implementation of a mlp with one layer with `Numpy`](https://github.com/wikistat/High-Dimensional-Deep-Learning/tree/master/BackPropagation)


* Convolutional neural networks: convolutional layer, pooling, dropout, convolutional network architectures (ResNet, Inception), transfer learning and fine tuning, applications for image or signal classification.  
**Application** : [Image classification on *MNIST* and *CatsVsDogs* data with `Tensorflow`](https://github.com/wikistat/High-Dimensional-Deep-Learning/tree/master/ImageClassification)


* Encoder-decoder, Variational auto-encoder, Generative adversarial networks


* Functional decomposition on splines, Fourier or wavelets bases: cubic splines, penalized least squares criterion, Fourier basis, wavelet bases, applications to nonparametric regression, linear estimators and nonlinear estimators by thresholding, links with the LASSO method.


* Anomaly detection for functional data: One Class SVM, Random Forest, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor. Applications to  anomaly detection in functional data.

 

## Organisation : 

* Lectures : 15 H .

* Practical works : 25 H applications on real data sets with the softwares R and Python's libraries Scikit Learn and Keras -Tensorflow.
